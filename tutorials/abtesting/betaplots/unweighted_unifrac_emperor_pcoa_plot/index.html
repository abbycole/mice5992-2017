        <h1>WebGL is not enabled!</h1>
        <p>Emperor's visualization framework is WebGL based, it seems that your system doesn't have this resource available. Here is what you can do:</p>
        <p id="explanation"><strong>Chrome:</strong> Type "chrome://flags/" into the address bar, then search for "Disable WebGL". Disable this option if you haven't already. <em>Note:</em> If you follow these steps and still don't see an image, go to "chrome://flags/" and then search for "Override software rendering list" and enable this option.</p>
        <p id="explanation"><strong>Safari:</strong> Open Safari's menu and select Preferences. Click on the advanced tab, and then check "Show Developer" menu. Then open the "Developer" menu and select "Enable WebGL".</p>
        <p id="explanation"><strong>Firefox:</strong> Go to Options through Firefox > Options or Tools > Options. Go to Advanced, then General. Check "Use hardware acceleration when available" and restart Firefox.</p>
        <p id="explanation"><strong>Other browsers:</strong> The only browsers that support WebGL are Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Please switch to these browsers when using Emperor.</p>
        <p id="explanation"><em>Note:</em> Once you went through these changes, reload the page and it should work!</p>
